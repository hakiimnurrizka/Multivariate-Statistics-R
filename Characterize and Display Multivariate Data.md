# Characterizing and Displaying Multivariate Data in R

As the name suggests, when dealing with multvariate data, we are dealing with high dimensional data. In this opportunity, i would like to share just a tiny bit of knowledge about dealing with multivariate data, in a more specifics term, how to characterize and display the multivariate data.

To start off, lets get our data. We are using iris data which, if you are familiar with R, you are probably already know this data before.
